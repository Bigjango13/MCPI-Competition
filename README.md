# My MCPI mods

This repo holds many of my MCPI mods.

So far the mods are:
- [Extended Creative Inventory](extended-creative-inventory)
- [Jetpack](mcpi-competition/week-1)
- And a few more mods in [Misc](misc).

# Building

It is pretty simple to build, you can use `./build.sh` to build all the mods or if you only want to build one you can use `./build.sh folder-name`. The mods will be in `out/`.

# Installing

To install you can move the mod files to `~/.minecraft-pi/mods`.

If you don't want to compile the mods yourself then you can look in releases, where a zip file with all the mods can be found.
