# Week 1 - Space

The first week, the theme was space, at first I wanted to make a mod that turned the world into the moon using tile overriding. I quickly realized that it was a bit boring and thought that jetpacks might be more fun. As I had never made a custom item and no one had made custom armor, I desided to make chestplates work as jetpacks, with the leather jetpack you could glide, chainmail and gold let you lift of the ground slowly, iron launched you 2 blocks, and diamond sent you an astonding 4 blocks. After I finished this mod I found that I had two more days left, so I backed up the first jetpack mod and started working on custom armor. I think it turned out pretty well.
